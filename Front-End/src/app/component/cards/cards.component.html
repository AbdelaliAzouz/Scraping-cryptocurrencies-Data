      <h3 class="card-title">What is cryptocurrency and how does it work?
      </h3>
      <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">A brief explination of cryptocurrencies</h6>
      <p class="card-text">Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all 
        transactions updated and held by currency holders.
        Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to
         solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, 
         then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.
        If you own cryptocurrency, you donâ€™t own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a record 
        or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.
        Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are still 
        emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds, stocks, and 
        other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.</p>
